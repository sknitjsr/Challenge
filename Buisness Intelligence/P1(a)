PROBLEM 1 :

It has three columns
session_id : Global session id,
user_id : unique Id of user,
created_at : time of opening that session. Format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'

Statement a ):
If a user opened his first session at Bobble App at 5th Nov then he will be called new user for 5th Nov. Similarly a user when opens his first session at any day then he will be counted as a new user for that particular day.
You need to provide date wise new user count at Bobble App acquired in November Month.

Solution :
-----------

Thought Process - 
          As its an Android App , We can use SQL query on the session_tables to find unique user on a particular day in November

For example :
        QUERY Below helps us to get count of users who logged at 4th November



SELECT  COUNT(Distinct user_id)

FROM    session_tables

WHERE   created_at >= '2019-11-04 00:00:00'

AND     created_at <  '2019-11-05 00:00:00'

GROUP   BY
	created_at

HAVING  COUNT(Distinct user_id) > 1

ORDER   BY
	created_at

If we need to find all users for a particular month , We can simply make A PL/ SQL task to achieve this .
