P2) Estimate number of cricket balls you can fill in a Volvo Bus.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Assumption :
Cricket ball , 3cm
Volvo - Cuboidal , 15*3*2

Solution :

To approach this answer, consider size of 1 average Cricket ball.

So average radius is around 3 cms.

Hence, we can calculate its volume by formula to calculate volume of sphere (4/3*π*r^3) which would turn around to be near 

= 36 cubic cms = 0.000036 cubic meters 


Here, we can assume volvo bus to be a cuboidal body.

So calculate volume of bus = length*breadth*height

In this formula, take length as 15 meters and breadth to be 3 meters and height to be 2 meters.

So volume of a volvo bus = 90 cubic meters

Take packing fraction into account.

So,

90 × 0.68 = 61.2

No of balls that can fit in a volvo bus = 61.2 / 0.000036 = 17,00,000 balls

Answer, 17 lacs balls.
